# Guidelines for Opensource Maintenance and Communication

## How to contribute: 
* Follow the Installation Guide at to the bottom of the [README](https://github.com/lalimabhola/TAG/blob/prototype3/README.md)
* Always...
  * follow the specifications listed below for proper code
  * work on a separate branch 
  * make additional issues if you encounter bugs
  * maintain a similar program structure as the existing program 

## How to organize issues/bugs: 
* Issues can be listed in the Kanban board within a project or listed in the "issues" tab of the repository
  * These can be categorized into "To-do", "In Progress", and "Completed" issues
  * If a developer wants to work on an issue, they should assign it to themself to avoid miscommunication between developers


## Where to discuss future plans and communicate with other developers: 
* Future plans can be communicated in the dicussion board within a Github project. 
  * [This link has instructions on how to navigate to the discussion board](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/creating-a-team-discussion)
  * Developers should maintain professional language and behavior when using these discussion board
  * Developers should also be considerate and open-minded about other ideas
* An additional category in the Kanban board can include "Future tasks" where future plans can be listed as issues
  * Once developers choose to work on issues, they should still assign it to themselves and move it to the "In Progress" section 
* New issues can also be proposed in the discussion board

## How to determine accepted code: 
### Code must meet the following specifications:
1. `Consistently formatted`
2. `Concise and elegant`
3. `Contain proper documentation explaining design decisions`

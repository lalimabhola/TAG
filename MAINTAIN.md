# Guidelines for Opensource Maintenance and Communication

* Research how major opensource projects, such as Canvas, Rails, etc. facilitate communication amongst community members and contributors, and how they maintain the projects' code. Where do they organize issues and bugs? Where do they discuss ideas for the project? What processes do they require contributors to follow in order to contribute to their project? How do they determine which code is accepted?




* Based on your findings, design a set of guidelines and processes for your project. Be sure to specify: where community members will discuss and organize issues and bugs; where they will discuss future plans; the processes to be followed for contributors to contribute code to the project; and guidelines to determine which code is accepted.

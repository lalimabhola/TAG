# Track and Give (TAG)

## Project Description

This website will track donors and donations to allow nonprofits to better streamline their process of reallocating donations to other distribution centers, who in turn give these donations to the homeless or those who are unable to afford them.

## Project Intent 

My project is innovative because the charity of my inspiration (Unforgotten Haven) currently does not have a computerized process of tracking donors or donations, so this would help make their nonprofit more efficient. My website will address the problem of neglecting individuals in poverty because if donations can be tracked more efficiently, then they can be distributed more efficiently. This should increase the chance that more individuals will receive donations compared to the current process of manually maintaining these donation supplies. Also, I would like to record the location in which specific items are available. By implementing this, distribution centers can find the closest locations to give their resources.

## Example Usage 

The three main functions of my program are searching within the data, adding data, and deleting data. My program will take user input and, based on the selected operation, perform one of the three functions on that piece of data. In the instance that a donation was received and workers want to add to the supply, then can select the data from a dropdown menu and the quantity of items to easily add that information. Administrators should be able to add or delete data, whereas general users might benefit the most from viewing the data rather than performing these functions. I will focus on New Jersey as the scope of charities and donation centers for this project. The reason I am focusing the operations performed on the data is because the main goal of my program is to allow workers in nonprofit organizations to track their supply of donations to better redistribute them.

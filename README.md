# Track and Give (TAG)

### Project Description

This website will track donors and donations to allow nonprofits to better streamline their process of reallocating donations to other distribution centers, who in turn give these donations to the homeless or those who are unable to afford them.

My project is innovative because the charity in focus currently does not have a computerized process of tracking donors or donations, so this would help make their nonprofit more efficient. My website will address the problem of neglecting individuals in poverty because if donations can be tracked more efficiently, then they can be distributed more efficiently. This should increase the chance that more individuals will receive donations compared to the current process of manually maintaining these donation supplies. Also, I would like to record the location in which specific items are available. By implementing this, distribution centers can find the closest locations to give their resources.
